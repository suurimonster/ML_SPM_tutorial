# ML_SPM_tutorial
This is material for a 1-day tutorial introducing some basic ideas in handling scientific data and applying machine learning methods to microscopy data. The idea is to work through the following files:

* coding.ipynb - brief introduction to Python approaches to data and image handling
* ml.ipynb - brief introduction to machine learning in the context of Scanning Probe Microscopy, with main emphasis on Neural Networks

Each contains an opening *lecture* to outline some key ideas, followed by a series of tutorials that reinforce the concepts with practical applications.

## Prerequesites

* Background - we assume a basic knowledge of physical concepts and scanning probe microscopy. Understanding the basics of coding in any language will help, but is not essential.
* Software - the following packages should be installed:
  * Anaconda (then all the following should be easily installable using conda)
  * jupyter notebook (or jupyterlab)
  * OpenCV
  * scikit learn
  * Tensorflow
  * pytorch
